All personnel worked 10 hours regular time today.

Site arrival time was 6:00 AM, departure at 5:00 PM. Weather was clear and sunny, perfect working conditions all day.

Team one completed electrical panel installation on level three and began circuit testing. Team two finished water heater connections on levels one and two, and started level five plumbing rough-in. Team three worked on elevator shaft preparation and installed safety barriers. Team four handled fire suppression system installation on level four.

Off-site work included Brad Horton and Austin York at the ISO flex facility for 10 hours, completing custom fabrication work for the main electrical room.

We received delivery from Ferguson at 7:30 AM - specialized valves and fittings for the mechanical room. At 11:00 AM, McComb Group delivered the remaining Pro Press fittings and copper pipe. Both deliveries were complete and on schedule.

We also received an unexpected delivery from Johnson Controls at 2:30 PM for the building automation system components, which arrived a day early.

No constraints or delays today. Work proceeded ahead of schedule due to good weather and full crew availability. One minor safety incident - Dalton Scott had a small cut on his hand from sheet metal, first aid was administered on site, no lost time.

Additional notes: Elevator inspector scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Need to ensure all safety protocols are in place. Concrete pour for level six scheduled for Friday if weather holds.
