Site arrival time was 6:00 AM, regular departure at 4:00 PM. Brigham and Reed stayed until 6:00 PM. Weather was cool and clear, excellent working conditions.

Team one completed all electrical final connections and successfully powered up the main electrical system for levels one through four. Team two finished pressure testing the entire plumbing system and began final fixture installations. Team three worked on elevator commissioning with the elevator contractor. Team four focused on interior finishing work including paint touch-ups and hardware installation.

Off-site work included Brad Horton, Mike Jones, and Austin York at the fabrication facility for 10 hours, completing the final custom components for the mechanical room.

We received delivery from Sherwin Williams at 9:00 AM for final paint colors and touch-up materials. At 11:30 AM, Signature Hardware delivered the specialty fixtures for the executive restrooms. Ferguson made their final delivery at 2:00 PM with remaining trim-out materials.

Emergency constraint occurred at 3:45 PM when a water line burst on level three due to excessive test pressure. Jeremiah Brigham and Dorian Reed stayed late to repair the line and clean up water damage. Temporary dehumidifiers were brought in. No other constraints or delays.

Safety incident: Water on floor created slip hazard during emergency repair - area was immediately cordoned off and cleaned. No injuries occurred but safety reminder issued about wet floor protocols.

Additional notes: Final building inspection scheduled for October 3rd. All punch list items 95% complete. Emergency repair will be inspected tomorrow morning. Project substantially complete pending final inspection.
