Project Columbus, 18th September 2025. Today we had 16 personnel on site. Aaron Trask, Corey Burchfield, Keith Thorpe, Roger Brake, Jeremiah Brigham, Dorian Reed, Bryce Shanklin, Kevin Zimmer, Ripper Reyes, Joshua Raikes, Robert Fletcher, Joseph Ferguson, Chase Poser, Dalton Scott, Ian Baker, and Manuel Robles. All personnel worked 8 hours regular time today. Dawn Guthrie and Rachael Todd were off sick.

Site arrival time was 6:30 AM, departure at 3:30 PM. Weather was partly cloudy with light rain in the afternoon that slowed exterior work for about 2 hours.

Team one focused on rough electrical on levels two and three, pulling wire and setting junction boxes. Team two continued plumbing rough-in on level one, connecting main water lines and installing drainage systems. Team three worked on HVAC ductwork preparation on level four. Team four handled material staging and site cleanup.

Off-site work today included Brad Horton and Jason Drake at the fabrication shop for 8 hours, working on custom electrical panels and conduit bending for next week's installation.

We received delivery from Westside Electric Supply at 10:15 AM - electrical panels, conduit, and wire for levels two and three. Delivery was on time and complete. We also took delivery from Home Depot at 2:00 PM for general supplies and safety equipment.

Constraints today included the afternoon rain delay and a brief power outage from 11:30 to 12:00 that stopped all power tool work. The concrete crew had to reschedule their pour due to weather. No safety incidents reported.

Additional notes: Need to coordinate with elevator contractor for next week's shaft work. Material storage area is getting crowded and needs reorganization.
