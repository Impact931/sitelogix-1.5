Project Columbus, 19th September 2025. Today we had 14 personnel on site. Aaron Trask, Corey Burchfield, Keith Thorpe, Jeremiah Brigham, Dorian Reed, Kevin Zimmer, Ripper Reyes, Joshua Raikes, Robert Fletcher, Joseph Ferguson, Ian Baker, Manuel Robles, Rachael Todd, and Jason Drake. Personnel worked varying hours due to equipment issues. Most worked 6 hours regular time today.

Site arrival time was 6:30 AM, early departure at 1:30 PM due to main power outage. Weather was overcast with high winds gusting to 35 mph, preventing any exterior or crane work.

Team one attempted to continue electrical work but was stopped by the power outage at 9:15 AM. Team two focused on manual plumbing assembly and pipe preparation that didn't require power tools. Team three worked on material organization and inventory. Limited productivity due to power and weather constraints.

Off-site work included Roger Brake, Bryce Shanklin, Chase Poser, and Dalton Scott at the warehouse for 8 hours, organizing incoming materials and preparing for next week's deliveries. Brad Horton, Mike Jones, and Austin York continued at ISO flex facility.

No deliveries scheduled or received today due to high wind warnings for delivery trucks.

Major constraints today included complete site power outage from 9:15 AM until end of day caused by utility company equipment failure. High winds prevented crane operations and exterior work. Dawn Guthrie called in sick. Several personnel sent home early due to limited work availability.

No safety incidents, but two near-miss reports filed due to loose materials in high winds. All materials secured before leaving site.

Additional notes: Utility company estimates power restoration by tomorrow morning. Need to reschedule concrete delivery planned for today. Site secured with extra tie-downs due to wind conditions.
