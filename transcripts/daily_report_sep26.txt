Project Columbus, 26th September 2025. Today we had 17 personnel on site. Aaron Trask, Dawn Guthrie, Keith Thorpe, Roger Brake, Jeremiah Brigham, Dorian Reed, Bryce Shanklin, Kevin Zimmer, Ripper Reyes, Robert Fletcher, Joseph Ferguson, Chase Poser, Dalton Scott, Ian Baker, Manuel Robles, Rachael Todd, and Jason Drake. Regular time was 9 hours for all personnel today.

Site arrival time was 6:30 AM, departure at 4:30 PM. Weather was warm and humid, 88 degrees with high humidity requiring additional water breaks.

Team one completed final electrical connections on level two and began testing all circuits and panels. Team two worked on hydronic heating system installation on levels three and four. Team three focused on elevator shaft finishing work and safety system installation. Team four handled punch list items on level one including touch-up painting and fixture adjustments.

Off-site work included Corey Burchfield, Joshua Raikes, Brad Horton, and Mike Jones at the downtown office building retrofit project for 9 hours, working on emergency lighting upgrades.

We received delivery from Grainger at 8:00 AM for maintenance supplies and replacement parts. Superior Plumbing Supply delivered specialized fittings at 1:15 PM that were back-ordered from last week. Austin York picked up custom fabricated parts from the metal shop.

Constraints today included a 45-minute delay waiting for building inspector who arrived late for the electrical rough-in inspection on level two. High heat required mandatory 15-minute breaks every 2 hours. One team member, Kevin Zimmer, left at noon due to heat exhaustion - medical attention provided, he was cleared to return tomorrow.

Safety incident: Minor electrical shock to Ripper Reyes while testing circuits - proper lockout/tagout procedures were reviewed with all electrical team members. Incident report filed.

Additional notes: Level two passed electrical inspection with minor notes. HVAC startup scheduled for next Tuesday. Need to coordinate final plumbing inspection for early next week.
