# **PARKWAY CONSTRUCTION — EXECUTIVE FIELD PERFORMANCE REPORT**

### **Month: July 2022**

**Prepared for:** Robert Trask – CEO | Aaron Trask – COO | Corey Birchfield – CFO
**Prepared by:** Operations Analysis Division
**Scope:** Aggregated data from all field daily reports (July 1 – July 31, 2022)

---

## **1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

July 2022 reflected **high labor intensity and environmental stress**, with recurring heat impacts and overtime (OT/DT) reliance to maintain production. Field documentation quality was solid, allowing attribution of performance and issues. Several vendor-related incidents were recorded, one resulting in a formal charge-back (Extra #22935). Inspections generally trended positive, but coordination issues and model mismatches caused avoidable lost time mid-month.

Financially, the month signaled **pressure on labor efficiency**—overtime averaged 13.8% of total hours—and revealed opportunities to standardize vendor performance tracking and preventive QC on penetrations and waterproofing.

---

## **9. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS / RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Implement “Lost Time Code” in Daily Logs** – Require numeric entry (min) + cause code to quantify avoidable downtime.
2. **Vendor Performance Dashboard** – Launch A–D grading; start with Luth and Concrete Coring for improvement plans.
3. **Heat Index Mitigation Policy** – Formalize early-start and mandatory cool-down protocols when > 95°F.
4. **Core Drilling QC Gate** – Add sign-off step for penetrations near waterproofing areas.
5. **Model Control Validation** – Require pre-pour QC check between layout and survey team to eliminate mid-day rework.
6. **Finance Integration** – Tie Extras and PO numbers to accounting system for automated recovery tracking.

---

## **10. OUTLOOK FOR AUGUST 2022**

* **Labor:** Expect normalization to ≈ 10% OT as heat eases.
* **Risk:** Continue monitoring Concrete Coring for method compliance.
* **Cost:** Charge-back for Luth incident to be processed and closed by mid-month.
* **Goal:** Implement pilot version of digital daily log system with automated analytics by August 15.

**Overall Executive Assessment:**
Parkway’s field operations in July 2022 remained resilient under environmental and coordination pressures. Documentation quality supports strong accountability. The key improvement vector lies in tightening overtime governance and codifying vendor performance analytics—measures that will directly defend margin and schedule reliability in Q3.
