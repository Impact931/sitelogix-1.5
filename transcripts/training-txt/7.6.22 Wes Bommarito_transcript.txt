Transcript: This recording is for Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, and Jim O'Loughlin both had eight hours working on finish. We shut the water off, swapped all the flushometer stops per request of the building owner. Cut and capped two copper lines underneath the slab and the personal wine vault. Caulked fixtures and started on the warehouse bathroom. And this completes my recording.
