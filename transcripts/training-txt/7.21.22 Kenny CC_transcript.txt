Transcript: Today is Thursday, July 21st, 2022, job reporting on incitement. Myself, I had six and a half hours. Scott Russell, six and a half, and Owen Glassburner, six and a half. We left early due to high temps. We got our 12-inch hole completed, the core machine off the wall, and piped through on a seven-line west elevation. Concrete coring is on site, and they're getting started on coring their holes. Four of us are gonna finish the last two, a 12-inch for an eight-inch storm, and a 10-inch for a six-inch sanitary on seven-line, or, I'm sorry, that is F-line, I believe, F-line, going out the west elevation. They got their bit stuck in the first hole, 12-inch hole. They're trying to get a push through. A guy from concrete coring said, if we can't get it through, we'll have to drill a larger hole, 14 over. I told him that's not an option, cuz we have to have a 12-inch hole over an eight-inch pipe for our link-sill system for waterproofing. So he's gonna have to cut his bit if that's the case, but he's gonna finish up Friday and hopefully get our other hole. I asked him to drill my sanitary hole first to get it done, and then cut your bit out and finish the other hole tomorrow when they come back. So we got all material on site. We are gonna get ready to do our storm piping on the west side of the detention box with Luth, hopefully, but we gotta wrap up their RCP pipe. Get that taken care of, get everything out of the way, and then we can get the rest of our storm done on that west elevation, so we complete everything. We also got our 2C pour completed, and we started shooting out in 2D area. Me and Owen will finish that on Friday. Scott's gonna be off on Friday. So me and Owen will get back up, total station 2D area, finish it up, do a double check on everything, and be ready for pour. That's it for the job for today.
