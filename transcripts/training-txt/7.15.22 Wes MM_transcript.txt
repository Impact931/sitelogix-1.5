Transcript: This recording is for Friday, July 15, 2022, Mellow Mushroom. Myself, Wes Clark, Jim O'Loughlin, and Owen all had eight hours today. I worked on overhead water tees and clamping down the copper in the racks, and then started on in-wall water. Jim and Owen worked on in-wall DWV. Almost completed it. We're waiting on stud walls to finish out the DWV. And then they worked on wrapping up the overhead fence. I have a couple more loose ends to wrap, finish it out. And this completes my recording.
