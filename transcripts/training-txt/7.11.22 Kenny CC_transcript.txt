Transcript: Today is June 11, 2022. Monday, job reporting on the Sightman. Myself, I had eight hours. Scott Russell, eight hours. Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. Our sub on-site was Lampke. We had our operator, Isaiah, for eight hours. And our laborer, Dan, for eight hours. Worked on our ground roof where we left off, over there in SOG B, heading towards SOG A. We had to start with relocating our 10-inch 45 elevation set on a storm line. I think it's that J5 or K line. We had to move that set further south to avoid a grade beam. Got that taken care of. Got some metal plates put up on the wall exterior of north side of 3 line where I had a sleeve that I installed in the wrong location. We got that anchored and closed off so that they can patch it from the inside. They'll put some rebar in there, and then they're going to patch it with some concrete. We're going to pick up our ground roof over in SOG A tomorrow. We were going to start wrapping around the lower level with our ground roof, the sanitarium, garageways, and then storm. But they're going to move us from this corner over to SOG A, and we're going to put some sanitary and some storm in tomorrow. Got a couple finger drains set in on some manhole area drains with luth over in SOG A as well. We're going to leave a couple of them out so that we can install our piping, and then we'll put those in after we get our sanitary in. We have an inspection called in for Tuesday for both the permit and our parkway permit on the Siteman Building. Let's see. We did have two inspections for today, but I canceled them. We didn't have anything in the morning. But I told Steve what we were going to be doing and told him that we'd let him look at some things the following day on Tuesday. That was it for the job for the day. Probably start on overtime on Tuesday. That was it. We had no deliveries. I did make an order with Ferguson. It's mainly some pipe and a few fittings. It's things that we're going to need to finish up ground roof in SOG A and B. That was it for the job for the day.
