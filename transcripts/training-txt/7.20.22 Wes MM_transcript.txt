Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Wednesday, July 20th, 2022. Mela Mushroom, myself, Wes Clark, and Jim O'Loughlin both had eight hours today. Jack is still out today. Worked on overhead water and in-wall water. Got it about 90% complete in the kitchen is what I would say. Still got the mop sink wall and a little bit to do in the back to finish up. And this completes my recording.
