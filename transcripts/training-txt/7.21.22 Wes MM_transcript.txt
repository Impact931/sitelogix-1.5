Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Thursday, July 21st, 2022, Mellow Mushroom. Myself, Wes Clark, had eight hours today. Jim O'Loughlin had four hours. He had an appointment at 11 o'clock today, so started at 6 30 so that he could get his four hours before he had to leave at 10 30. I worked on overhead water and in-wall water around the mechanical room and the water riser room and then worked on the private bathroom rough-in. And this completes my recording.
