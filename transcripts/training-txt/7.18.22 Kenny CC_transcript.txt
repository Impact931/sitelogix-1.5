Transcript: Today is July 18, 2022, Monday, job report and excitement. Myself, I had eight hours, Scott Russell, eight hours, Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. We did total station layout on second floor, two seat pour. We got that completed pretty much. We're short six inch sleeves, Eric's supposed to take care of that for me. We got a hold of Kyler from Fabric, ordered a 1932 lift to be delivered on Tuesday. The office has to follow up with updating credit info for Fabric so that we can get things running. So Alice is taking care of that. We started excavation on the west side of Seven Line, 10 inch storm, six inch sand. That's old shit, whatever. That was it for the project for the day. Luth is working on the manhole structure 3.0 in a Forest Park road. That's so we can get the detention box pipe, then we can start doing our ground rough. That was it for the project for the day.
