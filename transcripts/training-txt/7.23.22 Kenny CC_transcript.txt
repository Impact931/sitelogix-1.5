We got both, all three of our pipes are through the west elevation of F line with link seal. That's two 10-inch storms and one six-inch sanitary. Link seal's in, tightened up, everything's ready to go for the waterproofers on Monday morning. Paluth was on site working on the two garage drains that went across the ramp, eight-inch schedule 40 PVC. We didn't work on any of it with them. We ended up going home. The temperature, I don't even remember what it was, what it got to, 104. Anyway, it's just extremely hot, so we're going home. That was it for the project for the day.
