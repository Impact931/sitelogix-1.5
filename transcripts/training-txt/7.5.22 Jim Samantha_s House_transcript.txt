Transcript: This recording is for Tuesday, July the 5th, 2022, Jim, two hours at Robert's daughter's house. I went there to install shower doors. I met Nate, got in there, took everything apart, went through the directions and read them. Got everything kind of separated and found out what we had. All the material and parts that were needed were there. Went and started taking some measurements and started having some issues. Went back to the directions, tried coming up with some ideas and different scenarios. It wasn't looking like we were going to be able to install those particular shower doors because the shower base and the shower walls were different. And the shower walls actually had a setback of almost an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half. And then the threshold for the shower base wasn't wide enough, didn't have enough flat surface. So I was not going to be able to mount the sliding guide for the glass. And then the shower walls were only 72 inches and it was required that we had closer to 76 inches in height. I was not able to make that work. Went and talked to Robert. He suggested to get a hold of the manufacturer, see if we can come up with some different scenarios, some way to make it work. After waiting for almost 45 minutes, 50 minutes on hold trying to get somebody for technical support, finally spoke with someone. And the only option we could come up with was that the shower doors were not going to work. We did not have the height and we did not have the space to put the threshold down. The shower doors would leak and with the weight of the glass, they would probably fall if we tried rigging it to make it work. The only suggestion I could call and suggest to Robert was probably, I hate to say it, a shower curtain and shower rod. Then cleaned everything up, put everything back up, taped the box up as best I could and put it back against the wall. Texted Robert informing him that I was done. He sent me over to Bomberito Wine and Spirits with Wes to help him work and finish out my day. There's no other new direction from the superintendent, no delays, no rentals on the job and this concludes my report.
