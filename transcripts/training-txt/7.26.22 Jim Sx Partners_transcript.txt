Employee Name: Jim Sx Partners

Transcript: This recording is for Tuesday, July the 26th, 2022, gym, so eight hours, worked on surgery partners, worked on finish in the PT area, installing a toilet and getting the flushometer hooked up, and then working on two kitchen sinks, getting them hooked up, tested, caulked, everything's up and running, caulked two mop sinks, got them done and finished, and then went into the men's and the women's restroom and replaced the three faucets that had to be replaced from the punch list items. I was able to get all of them cleaned up, packed up all my stuff and tools, called in Eric and let him know that we were done out here, and then he needed to send Nate out for a pickup for all the remaining items that are left out here. There is no other new direction from the superintendent, no delays, no rentals on the job, and this concludes my report.
