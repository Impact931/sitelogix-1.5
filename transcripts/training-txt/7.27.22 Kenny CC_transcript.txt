Transcript: Today is June 27, 2022, Wednesday, job reporting on assignment. Myself, I had eight hours, Scott Russell, eight hours, Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. Rentals on site, we have 13219 Scissorlift inside the building. Deliveries for today, we had our connects box delivered by Bolin from Slough Jesuit over to the lay down area that was at 930, we got that dropped and set. We also had a one inch clean rock delivery that came at 845 AM this morning. We worked in SOG A with Luth on our 14 inch going into the detention box on the west elevation, we ran that upstream to the west. Put in our 14 inch branch or Y45 heading to the north to G1 com and then also heads to the west to pick up the ten inch coming from all the way west. After we got that in, we ran it up to our ten inch coming on west side of F line. We got that tied in 10 to 12 by 10 Y with a four inch clean out at the end of the run. Inspections called in and Luth is back from, we used Luth for seven hours. We had them both on an excavator and a skidster and we used their sewer laser for shooting our grade at 1% fall. I got pictures of everything, we got our high early strength concrete patch collar put around our 14 inch where it enters into the detention box. We also have our 14 heading to the north for G1 closed off and staked in front of it and back filled to pick it up on Friday. CSI will be pouring on Thursday so we won't be in that area. That was it for the project for today. As far as extras, we have an upcoming extra we're gonna do on Thursday per Bob, the superintendent. We're gonna tie on to our ten inch at column line, I guess that would be F 5.5 with a band and we're gonna put a ten by six reducer bushing on there and go to a six by four double Y with three two inch pressure connections, female for hoses for temporary pumping in the lower level. As a project duration continues, that was it for the project for today.
