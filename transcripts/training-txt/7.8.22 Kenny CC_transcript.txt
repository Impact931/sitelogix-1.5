Transcript: Today is July 8th, 2022. Friday, job report on excitement. Myself, I had eight hours. Scott Russell, eight hours. Olin Glassbrenner, eight hours. We have our 10-inch hole complete through a lower level. We got a rental from K&K, obviously. We'll be able to start on ground rough come Monday. The rental worked. We were still having a little trouble with it. We did determine that some of the trouble we were having was an extension I got from Merlin Stelzer. It was a used one, but I had a brand new one, so we used that one. We were able to get through. We were running off a 100-foot course, closest electric we could get, but the hole is complete. We will be able to roll with ground rough come Monday when Lamke gets on site. I did work on control points again up on the 2C area. Again, still having trouble, even with the XY positioner. I had a bracket strapped to the steel as best I could, but it was still, it was coming out of level, out of tilt, out of tolerance. Wasn't able to take shots again. Eric was fabbing up a post for me to mount in, and I'm gonna have to pick that up from his shop, and hopefully we'll be able to get something going on Saturday, because I still couldn't get set up. I had the control points on the map. It's finally downloaded. I was having trouble again with the total station, but Aaron was able to give me a new password, and I was able to get into it. But something's still not right. I can't set up. Hopefully Wes is gonna be able to, so we were not able to insert anything in that 2C area. Did get two more sticks of 8-inch ductile iron installed with luth over in SOG A off the area drain, heading towards the west. At 1%. We're through our sleeve that I put in grade beam D for them. Everything's working out fine. I'm not sure if we'll continue further, or I believe they said they're gonna not gonna excavate until Monday, and they'll keep heading towards the west. Again, LAMPK will be on site Monday, and we'll start our ground rough, and we will be going on overtime. Supposed to be working 10-hour days approved by Clayco. That was it for the job site for the day. I do have all sleeves and all inserts on site, and up on top of the deck ready to go. Wes will be on site Saturday, along with Scott. It'll just be three of us, and we'll start inserting that deck, hopefully. That was it for the project for today. Oh, I did get a load of 1-inch clean I received at about 1230 in the afternoon, and I did stage that down by the old ramp down to the lower level, because that's where we're going to be working, in SOC B slash A area. We got that from New Frontier, 1-inch clean. That was it for the project for today.
