Transcript: Today is June 14th, 2022, Thursday, job reporting on assignment. Myself, I had eight hours, Scott, Russell, eight hours, Owen, Glass, Brenner, eight hours. We worked in SOG B to A. We had Lampke on site, our sub, Dan, our labor, and Isaiah, our operator, both eight hours. We graded and finished up our six-inch sanitary north of three line, along with our four-inch garage waste. We also started doing our excavation on west of seven line for our eight-inch, ten-inch storm that's at a lower elevation, and then we'll have to lay it, bury it, and then put our six-inch sanitary in above that. We did decide to go on the inside of the shoring wall to make it easier for us, and then we generate less spoils as well. Come to find out, our sleeves inside don't match our flow lines outside. The details I got from Zach, I'm measuring it, it measures exactly on on the inside, but flow lines are a foot higher on the outside. Went ahead and took shots, verified, checked dimensions again, talked to Eric several times. Come to find out, it was a design flaw. Apparently, there was an elevation down on a lower level that changed by a foot early on in the project. It wasn't carried through to our plumbing drawings and our details on our sleeves, so our sleeves ended up getting installed wrong. They're all in lower than they should be. So there's two more holes that'll have to be cored, 12-inch for eight-inch storm, twice, and one ten-inch hole for a six-inch sanitary. That was it for the project for today. Looks like we're going to be working Saturday, getting across the road in front of the existing parking garage west of the site there in SOG 8 area. This has been approved by Clayco as well. Let Eric know, and all materials on site to do this. That was it for the job for today.
