Employee Name: Kurt Meharry

Transcript: It's Kurt Smith calling in time for my Harry Medical College job for Monday, July 25, 2022. We came in at 6.30, we left at 3.00. Kurt Smith, Jack Baird, Ron Smith, Doug Craddock, Tony Dixon, Dalton Scott, Thomas Parker, Catherine Zarbok, and Nathan McMillan at eight hours. We completed the second floor filling holes for fire caulking and cleaned up boost ends and I turned into QC for 2B. We continued installing domestic water piping mains on the second floor. We continued on the fourth floor installing roof drains and overflow piping and installing domestic water piping for living spaces. We moved temporary roof drain piping and sealed the joints for corrugated pipe on the sixth floor. That was about two hours on that move, so if you want to try to get a ticket on that, please let me know.
