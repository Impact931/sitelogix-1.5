Transcript: The thing is for Friday, July the 1st, 2022, surgery partners, gym, six hours, finished up the last of the stuff that I could finish in Reyes. I still have mop sink to take care of, getting it caulked in and finished after they get the floors in. I got the hot water system up and running. Looks like it's holding pretty good around 108, 110 degrees. That's where I got it balanced. I only have one water heater running because the company that is servicing the water heater that has the missing part that's under warranty, they did not come out yesterday as they were supposed to. The gas line is still disconnected and we'll be waiting on that so we can get it going. But in the meantime, I went around and flushed all the water lines out, got hot water, balanced at the mixing valves for the four toilets. Everything is pretty much up and running. I spoke with Tyler. He said they're going to start, they're supposed to start on the flooring next week up in the physical therapy so hopefully they'll have that finished and ready for the following week. He said he would call me and let me know and at the same time, the following week is about a rough idea of when the faucets are supposed to be in. They're supposed to be replaced so I'll have the remaining finish to be worked on over there. And so there's no other new direction from the superintendent. There's no new direction. There's no delays, no rentals on the job. I got everything cleaned up and put away and locked up and this concludes my report.
