Employee Name: Wes Bommarito

Transcript: This recording is for Thursday July 7th, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, had eight hours of Bomberito. Wrapped up the warehouse bathroom, changed out a broken grid drain in the main bathroom, fixed two leaks in the main bathroom that were overnight small drips, and then completed the humidifier line for the personal wine vault. All that's left to finish out Bomberito is to cap a waistline, under slab in the personal wine vault, and then hook up a dishwasher in a break room. This completes my recording.
