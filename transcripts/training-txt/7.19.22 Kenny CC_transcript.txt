Transcript: Today is July 19, 2022, Tuesday, job report on excitement. We have high heat index warnings for most of this week. Clayco brought it up in a meeting this morning, so we're gonna keep an eye on that. Today, myself at eight hours, Scott Russell, eight hours, Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. Owen watched our concrete pour that we had up on the second floor, bid 2B pour, everything went fine in there. Worked on the lower level, A, on corn holes. We have to core two 12s in a 10-inch hole. That's for two 8-inch storms, one 6-inch sanitary. We had an elevation issue in our model, so the sleeves got set in wrong, so we're coring. Also worked in SOG A on 18-inch RCP pipe with a luth from manhole 3.0 to 3.1. We passed our city inspection on all that. We did receive our scissor lift from Fabric around 1.30. They had no diaper with it. Calling back, asked for the diaper. It got out to the project at 2.40 PM, so we weren't able to use the lift, but we did commandeer one for Clayco, and we did get started on our coring. We did have a leak on a core machine, oil leaking out of the motor. I got a hold of Rick from K&K, where we're renting it, and he's getting me a new one out on Wednesday, so we'll swap it out. Hopefully be able to finish our hole. I did talk to Eric about hiring concrete coring. Hopefully, we decide to do that. So then we're gonna keep moving forward with these holes and get everything out that west elevation, so we can backfill on the outside and be done with it. That's it for the project for today. Our scissor lift is a JLG 1932, lift number J29590. It's our first rental on site from Fabric. That's it for the job for today.
