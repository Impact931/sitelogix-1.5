Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Wednesday, July 13th, 2022. Mellow Mushroom, myself, Wes Clark, Jim O'Loughlin, and Jack Obermiller all had eight hours today. Jack and Jim completed the water hangers. Jim started stringing up water pipe and started on the vent hangers and piping. I assisted him with stringing up water pipe as he needed. Jack broke up the concrete and moved pipes into walls for the trough drain vent and the employee bathroom lavatory and then also broke up around the mop sink to move that. I worked on, finished laying out the wall roughs. I had some issues that I had to go over with the superintendent about. Things that were changed, things that were not coordinated correctly between drawings. I did some material handling and then I finished out my day starting wall roughs, getting slide brackets in and marking centers of where water is going to be. Should be able to start on that first thing in the morning tomorrow. Getting that pipe in. I had a couple deliveries from Nate. I think it was two, maybe three. And this completes my recording.
