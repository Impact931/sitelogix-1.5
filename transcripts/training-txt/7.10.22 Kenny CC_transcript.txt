Transcript: Today's July 10th, Sunday, 2022, job reporting on Sightman. Myself, I had eight hours double time. Wes Clark, eight hours double time. We got everything set up. Total station, again, set up fine. We laid out from the north side heading towards the south and wrapping the west. We only had to reset up one time to be able to shoot around columns, but we were able to set up on CSI's post, which helped save us a little time. Everything is inserted in the deck of 2C for the next pour, including the top of the ramp, because that's a separate part of the pour. Our two sleeves are in for our storm overflows. We shimmed them with one inch shims, and I put some great stuff foam in there to close up the gap, because there's a one inch per foot slope on that ramp. So it'll work out fine. All our inserts are in. All our sleeves are in. We'll just have to adjust the heights come Monday morning. But they're going to start setting still, and we need to get ahead of them, and we're complete. I did talk to Eric about having Jack over next week to just continue shooting, even outside the pour, so we stay ahead and we're not caught off guard. That was it for the project for the day. I'm going to have Nate come Monday and pick up the core machine that we rented from K&K, and he can take that to another project or return it, whatever they want to do, including our 10 inch bit that I use. That was it for the project for the day.
