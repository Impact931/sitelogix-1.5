Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Monday, July 25th, 2022. Mellow Mushroom, myself, Wes Clark, Jim O'Loughlin, and Jack Obermiller all had eight hours today. Worked on in-wall water roughing, the bar water. And then as we were testing, we found a couple leaks on the overhead vents. Had to run and get a couple parts for that. We had the entire kitchen minus the bar, got an inspection on that, and it was passed. And all of the overhead vents in the kitchen. The only thing that's left to inspect for final roughing is going to be the private bathroom, the bar wall, and the public bathroom. Probably going to get started on running water to the public bathroom, have a stack to cut into for the private bathroom, and then some repairs to make in the public bathroom from broken fittings, things like that. Probably got a couple more days here and then going to get my final roughing inspection. And we'll be done here until finish is ready to be set. This completes my recording.
