Transcript: It's Tuesday, July 26, 2022. Job reporting on a slew, Jesuit Hall. I had an hour on site. I had to go there and tighten up link silf around three quarter inch pipe going out a six inch sleeve out the north. It was leaking. I guess it got water in the storage area downstairs, but it all got cleaned up. I tightened up the link sill. Everything, things seem to be better now. So we'll see what happens. It was a lot of rain, about seven and a half inches overnight. So typically it's not that much rain. So I do believe Eric said that there wasn't even waterproofing on that wall. So hopefully they can figure out if there's any other problems, they can take care of those. But I think we should be good. That was it for the job for the day.
