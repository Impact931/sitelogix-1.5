Transcript: Today is June 16, 2022, Saturday. Job reporting on the sitemen. Myself, eight hours, time and a half. Scott Russell, eight hours, time and a half. Jack Obermiller, eight hours, time and a half. We didn't do any total station layout on the second floor of the 2V port area. We did, however, install about 365 foot of pipe. That includes 8-inch storm on west elevation of 7-line on the outside exterior. Also, we piped that down to the next 8-inch storm into the building where it transitions to 10-inch. And that's all the way down to the north past our sanitary and garage way so that we can pick up it all later. We got that back filled, tamped in, graded out to where we can lay the 6-inch sanitary on top of that and also lock that in with rock. We did tie in that 6-inch sanitary at the northwest corner from the 6-inch sanitary that heads all the way to the east for the tie-in. I did shoot flow lines on our sanitary, did the flow line measurements. I shot finish floor, reset up the eye on the story pole, and then went to the ditch and shot our 6-inch sanitary there at northwest corner that came from 300 feet away. It is Nat's ass on the flow line money. I am confident with all the flow lines and the ground rough out here. I'm not confident with other things, but I am confident with that. We did get the 8-inch sanitary tied in from the SOG A. Let's see, that would be grade beam C of loose. We got that all the way across the area drained by D line, just west of D. That's all tied in. We got that back filled up. Then we installed our 8-inch storm over to column line, I believe that's C2. We got that stubbed up, 8-inch storm. Got that back filled, and then we installed our 6-inch sanitary that we had over there at SOG A that continues over to grade beam E. We have it across the road and through grade beam D wall. I'm sure we'll have to cut it off and put it through sleep later, but it's all installed. They're going to pour or pave over there, that entrance area, Monday. All that's in, that leaves probably 200 feet or less of pipe in the underground that is complete. We're going to be waiting on loose work. I did talk to Bob. Lampke's going to be out of here for a while. When they do come back, we may have about two, three days, and then the ground rough will be 100% complete. That was it for the project for the day.
