Report Name: 7.5.22 Wes MM & Bommarito_transcript

Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Tuesday, July 5th, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, had two hours at Mellow Mushroom, watched the concrete pour. And then I went over to Bomarito, and I had six hours there setting finish. Jim met me there, and he also had six hours setting finish. Had some issues with some repair flanges, and some of the water closet flushometers didn't line up with spuds, so we'll need to shut the water off tomorrow. And this completes my recording.
