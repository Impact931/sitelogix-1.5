Transcript: Today is July 15, 2022, Friday. Job report on a siteman, myself. I had nine hours, Jack Obermiller nine hours, Scott Russell nine hours. We worked on a second floor, 2B, poor area, inserting the deck, total station. We got our steel bracket mounted or anchored down to the top of a column and started shooting. We're probably about 80% shot out, but we had to also do some, let's see, that was it. We got that shot all day long. That was Scott and Jack, myself. I bounced back and forth, worked with Lampke over on the west elevation of 7 line. I got the entire run excavated for our 8 inch and 10 inch storm. We got flow lines established on the sides of the wall so that we're going to end up coring is what the solution is from the problem that we found prior yesterday. Lots of sleeves being in wrong in the model, so we're going to end up having to core them whole. We're laying the pipe in, we're going to backfill, and then we're going to lay sanitary. It's going to be all day excavating. We probably won't lay pipe until Saturday, but I'll get the pipe all ready to go. Fittings are on site, pipe's ready. We won't have to have any haul off trucks, so I believe we'll get that wrapped up tomorrow. That was it for the project for today. We did get all our sleeves and everything out on site from Nate early in the morning. That included also the core machine that we got on rental from K&K because they're working on ours with the 12 inch bit. It already had the 10 inch out here, so when we find time, we'll get to coring. That was it for the project for today. We did receive one load of 1 inch clean, I believe, for our ground roof. That was it for the project for today.
