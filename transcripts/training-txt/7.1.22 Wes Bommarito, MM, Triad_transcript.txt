Employee Name: Wes Bommarito

Transcript: This recording is for Friday, July 1st, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, had five hours at Bomarito Wines and Spirits. I worked on setting finish, and then I got called away to go to the Mellowbush Room, where I had two hours fixing foundry that was out of level or was not at the right elevation. And then after that, I had one hour at the eye doctor's office to install a floor drain cover. I had to go to Home Depot to pick up a floor drain cover for that, and then caulked it in to make sure that it would stay watertight. And this completes my recording.
