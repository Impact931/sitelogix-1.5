Transcript: This recording is for Thursday, July 14, 2022. Mellow Mushroom, myself, Wes Clark, and Jim O'Loughlin both had eight hours today. Jack Obermiller had five hours today. He ended up getting pulled and going to the shop, finishing out the day there. I worked on in-wall PVC and drilled some studs out. Jack finished up drilling studs out and worked on overhead PVC with Jim. And then Jim started on the in-wall copper for a few areas. And this completes my recording.
