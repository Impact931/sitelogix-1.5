Transcript: This recording is for July 12, 2022. Mellow Mushroom, myself, Wes Clark, Jim O'Loughlin, and Jack Obermiller all had 8 hours today. Jack and Jim worked on hanger installation. Water hangers are about 90% complete. And this morning I had Jack break up the floor and move two pipes that were out of the wall in the dishwashing area. It took them about an hour and a half to break up and move the pipes. And then Joe from Knoebel poured back the hole that was chipped up. I worked on doing layout for all of the overhead. Finishing snapping out a couple lines here and there for the water. And then working on routing the vents to see where we'll make our tie-ins to utilize the most vents and use the least amount of pipes. And then I started laying out the end wall heights and locations for all the water and waste stub-outs. I did an overhead vent take-off and submitted that to Eric to be ordered through Ferguson. I had one delivery from Nate today with the Macho Hammer so that Jack could break up the concrete around those two pipes. And this completes my recording.
