Employee Name: Kurt Meharry

Transcript: It's Kurt Smith calling in time from a hairy medical job for Tuesday, July 12th, 2022. We came in at 6.30, we left at 3. Kurt Smith, Josh Kay, Jack Baird, Richard Holt, Ron Smith, Doug Craddock, Tony Dixon, Dalton Scott, and Thomas Parker all had eight hours. We continued on the second floor installing domestic water piping mains. We completed third floor installing water piping in-walls for living spaces. We continued on the sixth floor installing sanitary vents through the roof. And we continued on the second floor, I'm sorry, on the third floor installing roof drain lines.
