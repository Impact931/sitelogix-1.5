Transcript: This recording is for Monday, July 18th, 2022. Jack Obermiller and Jim O'Raughlin both had eight hours today at the Mellow Mushroom. I had three and a half. I got pulled away to go to Slough Jesuit Hall. The overhead vents are wrapped up in the kitchen, and in-wall water piping is being continued. Still got a little bit left to go on that. And then I had four and a half hours at Slough Jesuit Hall working on fixing the leak of the ice maker in the kitchenette. When I showed up, there was water damage in the dining room ceiling, and when I went upstairs to take a look at the dishwasher and ice maker, the ice maker drain line had been pulled out of the hub drain when BSI added a panel to the cabinetry. So this should all be on extra tickets, and we're not responsible for the drywall damage. This completes my recording.
