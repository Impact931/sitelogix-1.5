Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Monday, July 11th, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, had eight hours at Slough Jesuit Hall. Worked on finishing the job out. I had two ice makers to hook up, one in Hostas and one in the second floor kitchenette. Both had some issues with making the drain connections work. With them, BSI or Slough, supplying ice makers that weren't the right size for the openings that were given. But I did make everything work and got everything in. And then hooked up both waste in the sag proceeding. And then the faucet had to shut off the entire hot system for the building because the return line was bleeding water through after I shut the two valves off that went up to that area. And then I finished out the day caulking down the two toilets and two sinks in the public bathrooms next to the sag receipt room. I had to run to Home Depot to pick up some parts to finish out the job. And this completes my recording.
