Transcript: Today is July 6, 2022, Wednesday, job report on excitement. Myself had six and a half hours, Scott Russell six and a half, Owen Glassbrenner six and a half. Again, we left early due to high temps. Heat index is way over 100 both days in a row, so we're leaving early again. We have everything on a grease trap piped. We made repairs down in lower levels C where CSI broke a three inch mop sink riser that includes the santee in the ground that picks up the drain outside of it and a two inch vent on a floor drain all the way to the east of lower level C. I believe that's for a floor drain in a med gas room, possibly some type of med room. Anyways, those repairs are made and complete. We got the rock back in. Still needs to be poured back, but someone else will do that, I'm sure. We also got a, we're gonna get started on our ten inch hole, but we have problems with the core machine. So we got it to run and then it finally stopped on us. I'm gonna end up needing to get an extension for it so we can drill this hole further cuz it's pretty deep. So this is the hole over in area B and B4. Let's see, sanitary coming out of lower level B and the SOG B. That was it for the project for today.
