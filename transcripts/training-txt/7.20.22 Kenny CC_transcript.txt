Transcript: Today is July 21st, 2022, Wednesday, job report and on-site. Myself, I had six and a half hours, Scott Russell, six and a half, Owen Glassburner, six and a half. We left early due to high temps, we were triple digit heat index. I'll let the office know, Clayco knows everyone on site pretty much left after lunch. We got our ten inch hole, I'm sorry, our first 12 inch hole completed for our eight inch storm. That would be all the way north on the west elevation. The other two concrete corn came out, took a look at them, they gave Eric Price, they're gonna core those for us on Thursday. We did get the new motor for the core machine from K&K. It's around mid-morning, wasn't there first thing, it's more closer to 1030. We just swapped out the motors, left the machine mounted. We did get our hole finished. We'll put pipe in tomorrow at length, so concrete coring is done with. The other two, we'll be able to put those in, we'll be done with that. Let's see, also worked on SOG A with Luth, and that's from manhole 3.1 to 3.2. We did pass an inspection on that as well, for the job, for the day.
