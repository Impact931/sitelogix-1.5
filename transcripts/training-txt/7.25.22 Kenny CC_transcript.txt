Transcript: Today's July 25th, 2022, Monday, job reporting on the Sightman. Myself, I had eight hours on Glassbrenner, eight hours. That was it on site. Luth had to finish up in there between garage drain 610 and 611, the 8-inch, so that we could go ahead and we could lay out and start our rest of our ground rough in SOG A area. That's the west side tie in the detention box. We got shots in. We got paint laid out for stub ups and connections. We found a way in across the RCP, the 15-inch RCP with our 14-inch. We're going to have to push our 14-inch Y upstream and move our 14-inch 45 downstream, tighten up the Y pattern there, make it more of a combo, push everything a little bit upstream with a grade beam so only one pipe's coming in under the grade beam instead of the two. And that way, we can get across the top of the RCP. It wasn't in the model when we designed it, so they didn't realize that the outside diameter was so big. And it was into our flow line where we were originally going to run. So we got that worked out. Luth started working on our grades for our storm piping, but by the time they got to them, we weren't able to get any pipe in because they had to clean all the shore box and everything off for pump trucks. So we're going to shoot for it again Tuesday, see what happens, and hopefully be able to finish it up. That was it for the job for the day. We did make sure we have all material on site, and everything is in the area and ready to go. That was it.
