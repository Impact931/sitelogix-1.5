Transcript: Today is July 28, 2022, Thursday. Job reporting on a siteman. Myself, I had eight hours. Scott, Russell, eight hours, and Owen Glassblender, eight hours. Rentals on site, we have 13219 Scissorlift from Fabric. We had no subs. Delivery was actually a pickup, PO number 223562 Atlas, and that's associated with extra number 22954. It's an extra per bob of Clayco. We connected our storm piping at wall line, exterior lower level wall line 7, F5.5. We tied on with a husky band, double Y, and put three schedule 80 female iron pipe connections for pump hoses to basement lower level out for temporarily on job. Let's see. Also, I got a city inspection on our SOG A storm piping with Luke. We passed that. That was an hour. We got our storm piping in from, let's see, detention box, west end to all the way up to the corner at the 12-inch Y before it heads west and picks up the storms at F line. We also got a branch in over to the north, but we're not going to run that yet until Friday. But that all got inspected, so we'll be able to wrap it up Friday. That was it for a project for the day.
