Transcript: This recording is for Wednesday, July 27, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, and Jim O'Loughlin both had eight hours at the Mellow Mushroom today, raising and adjusting carriers, rerouting water piping in the public bathrooms, and running new waste piping for the public bathrooms as well for the urinals and sinks. I also have one insulator here today. This completes my recording.
