Transcript: Today is July 7th, 2022, Thursday, job reporting on assignment. Myself, I had eight hours, Scott Russell, eight hours. And Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. We got our points for elevated deck area C, above SOG area. I had trouble setting up the whole deck sways. I had the clamp set up on a rebar eventually. Tried with setting up several different times. It's setting up a couple inches off. All trades are having trouble up here with everything swaying, the whole deck sways. CSI has a steel post they had made that they anchor into the concrete at the top of the columns. It seems to be working. I spoke with Eric, he's gonna work on this, but still I can't get set up. We're gonna try again, I'll try again Friday. Hopefully, we can get something going with the XY position, maybe it'll work out better. But we gotta get this thing laid out. Monday, they're dropping steel. I see we continued on our 10 inch hole over in SOG B through the lower level wall. I did get an extension at Merlin Stelzer, but we're having trouble getting through with the machine. We're gonna end up having to get a new machine. I talked to Eric, he's gonna talk to, but he's gonna have Nate go to K&K, get us a rental, and then we'll probably get ours repaired just so that we can get it done. That was it for the project for today. We'll get back on it Friday. Hopefully, we'll get everything done before Monday. It looks like we're gonna work Saturday. We got approval from Clayco to work on the inserting the deck over there in that two-seat area, including the top of the ramp. So it'll probably be a few of us Saturday. I'm gonna talk to Eric about that. That was it for the job for the day. I did get some ductile iron pipe in with Luth. We got the first area drain manhole set and stick a pipe out. I'm waiting on them to dig across so that we can get the rest in and hopefully be done with this SOG B area, SOG A B, A area really with Luth. Did get an inspection called in. We did get an inspection on a piece of pipe in our manhole. We'll call one in for tomorrow and we'll get everything else inspected. That was it for the project for today.
