Transcript: This recording is for Monday, July the 11th, 2022, Parkway North, Jim, 8 hours, Nate, 4 hours. We met in the shop, loaded up all the material, kind of went shopping through the shop, getting stuff for Parkway North. We got everything loaded up, and then Nate and I went and headed over to the job. I had Nate go through Home Depot and pick up some saw blades, drill bits, and angle grinder blades that we may need for any of this project. And then we met the superintendent. He let us in and out of the building. Each time we got the material stored in place in the corner of the upper gymnasium. We had to move some stuff around and get permission from the principal to put things in its place and set up our little corral area. We taped it all off, we stuck everything behind it, and I've got everything chained up and secured. Went in and out and around the building trying to figure out ways, what was the best way to go about core drilling or removing panels inside and trying to do the least amount of damage. Had a discussion about it with Eric and with Robert, then went over and spoke to the superintendent and project manager and engineer. We had a discussion and then we went over and looked at it. It was decided to go about our core drilling from the inside and not removing the panel and seeing how sturdy it is and trying to core drill through it. I was okay with that as long as they could supply me with something else to put on the wall to keep it on the stiff side because of the feet for the core machine. I didn't want them working a hole in the finished wall, which they said they would, and then they would also help protect the wood floor for the gymnasium. Once I started cutting the hole, I cut an 8x8 hole in the wall center where the drain is going to go out. Once I got the hole drilled through the concrete wall, I discovered the wall is only a half to maybe three quarters of an inch thick. It's on the thin side, at least where I'm drilling, so we won't even need a core machine. We will basically just be drilling a whole bunch of holes in the wall and knock it out that way because there's not enough concrete there to support anything. I've told Eric about this. I still have to go tell the superintendent at McCarthy so they know what our new situation is. I did get everything cleaned up in the entire area in that corner. There are locks coming through the two-inch conduit. I stuffed it and filled it with a rag, and then I stuffed the hole that I drilled with putty. I've cleaned up and secured the building as best I could. There's no other new direction from the superintendent. There's no delays, no rentals on the job, and this concludes my report.
