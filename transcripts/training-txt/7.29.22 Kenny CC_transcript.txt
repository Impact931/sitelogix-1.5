Transcript: Today is July 29, 2022, Friday, job reporting on excitement. Myself, I have seven hours total, Scott Russell, six, Owen Glassbrenner, six. We worked in Sauget on our storm piping, we got our 14 inch. We picked up on a branch heading north and we ran it up to the 45 stubbed out with 14 inch on a 45, coming up above one line. We won't be able to run it until CSI gets one line in, but it turns up on G1. We also put our connection in and ran to the west and picked up our 10 inch storm is coming through grade beam E, which is not installed yet, but we have pipe over it for a sleeve. That's all tied in and everything's been inspected by the city and passed. Sub we had with us that was digging for us was loose on excavation, and six hours on that after that point they were on backfilling of their own contract work, that was it for the project for the day. Thank you.
