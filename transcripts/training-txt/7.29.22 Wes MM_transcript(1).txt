Employee Name: Wes Clark

Transcript: This recording is for Friday, July 29, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, had seven hours, and Jim O'Loughlin had six hours today at the Mellow Mushroom. Worked on carrier repairs and replacing faceplates and gaskets after we found leaks on all of the carriers from testing. We tested the private bathroom stack, and our rough inspection was completed today. Also worked on clearing the job out and getting all of the tools that are supposed to be on my van back in my van. And this completes my recording.
