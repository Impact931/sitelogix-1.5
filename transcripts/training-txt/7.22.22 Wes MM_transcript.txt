Transcript: This recording is for Friday, July 22nd, 2022, Mellow Mushroom. Myself, Wes Clark, and Gemma Laughlin both had 8 hours today. Jack Obermiller came back from being sick and he had 8 hours as well. Worked on overhead water, in-wall water, and some overhead vents. Everything's just about wrapped up. Also started putting nail plates on and prepping for inspection. Have about half a day Monday to be able to get our inspection. It's going to be a partial and it's going to be all of the kitchen water and vents. And this completes my recording.
