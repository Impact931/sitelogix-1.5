Transcript: Today is July 22nd, 2022, Friday. Job reporting on a siteman. Myself, I had seven hours. Owen Glassbrenner, six and a half. We left due to high temps. Let's see, we got our, I worked with Luth, finished up the RCP from 3.2, detention box with our inspection from the city. I had two hours on that. Let's see, myself and Owen, we got up to the second floor on 2D area. We did total station. We got that whole area completed, our sleep set. Bangers are all down. Did a double check on 2C. Eric was on site. Hopefully he did his double check. I told him to go ahead and check 2D as well. We have that one completed. Concrete Coring did get the sanitary hole drilled for me, 10 inch, and then they ended up having to cut their bit out on the 12 inch hole they were drilling, but they did get it complete. They didn't finish until the end of the day, so myself and Owen will be in on Saturday. We'll have to wrap up the, getting the pipes through because waterproofers are coming in on Monday. If we can work with Luth on an eight inch pipe between garage drains 6.11 and 6.10, maybe, and 6.11, we will. It's going to be, depending on the temps, it's supposed to be 105 on a regular temp, so we'll do the best we can. That was it for the job for the day.
