Transcript: Today is July 13, 2022, Wednesday. Job reporting on a siteman. Myself, I had eight hours. Scott Russell, eight hours. Owen Glassbrenner, eight hours. We had our sub on site, Lamke. Operator Isaiah, eight hours. And our laborer, Dan, eight hours. We worked on parkway permit ground rough, SOG area B, six-inch sanitary, four-inch grease waste running on the north side of three line from east to west, flows to the east. We got that run in. We're about 20-foot shy of the corner and we'll make the turn tomorrow and we're going to run that west elevation on the west side of F line. That'll be 10-inch storm and six-inch sanitary. We passed our inspection on that to cover. We also worked on SOG A. Luth broke our eight-inch storm we put in prior the previous day, had it inspected and backfilled. Worked 10 hours, two hours overtime to complete that yesterday. So first thing this morning within the first hour, operator from Luth broke our eight-inch storm. It broke down in the ground on our 10 by 8 Y. So we had to replace that on an extra. That's extra number 22935. And that's going to be an operator three hours, a laborer three hours, plumbers three plumbers, two hours each, six total. That's excavate. That basically opened back up our 10 by 8 Y along with our 15-foot of 10-inch that runs downstream to the east. We had to dig that up, replace the Y, put the pipe back in with a sleeve on because it goes through grade beam E. That's complete and PO number was 223436. Used an atlas for the fittings. That's a 10 by 8 Y, 10 by 8 bushing, 8-inch street 45. And one 10-inch cap and one 8-inch cap. That completed work. We got that backfilled so we're not holding up CSI. That was it for the project for today. We did order a load of rock from New Frontier to be delivered on Thursday this 14th. Ma'am, I got a job to do please. Thank you. Let's see. We should start on our 6-inch storm and I'm sorry, 8-inch storm and 6-inch stand interior. It has to go across the existing parking garage on the double tree I guess right there. We'll be crossing that road on Saturday. Overtime work. Clayco approved this and they're the ones who scheduled it. So we'll be doing that Saturday. That's it for the job for the day.
