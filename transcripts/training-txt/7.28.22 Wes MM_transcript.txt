Transcript: This recording is for Thursday, July 28, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, and Jim O'Loughlin both had eight hours today at Mellow Mushroom. We wrapped up main bathroom, fixed the tie-in to the vent stack in the private bathroom, and cut and cap water in the water riser room at 1 Insulator today as well. This completes my recording.
