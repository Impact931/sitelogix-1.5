Transcript: Today is July 12, 2022, Tuesday, job reporting on a siteman. Myself, I had 10 hours, it's eight regular, two time and a half. Scott Russell, eight regular, two time and a half. Owen Glassbrenner, eight regular, two time and a half. Sub on site was Lampke. We had our operator Isaiah, again, 10 hours, eight reg, two time and a half. And our laborer, Dan, 10 hours, eight reg, two time and a half. We have no rentals on site. We had a delivery from Ferguson, piping some fittings, PVC, schedule 40 to complete SOG A and B. We received that delivery at 7 AM. No lost time. We did have some lost time waiting on Luth, getting over to SOG A. They were in our way unloading manhole structures and rock. Let's see. I'd say we lost a good two hours of time there. We were able to work on our north elevation of three line. And we did finally get over to between grade beams D and E. And we're able to install our eight inch storm and get it back filled so that CSI can continue forward and dig grade beam E and get that port so they can build up. We passed our inspection with the city on our parkway plumbing permit for ground rough and also our Luth permit for that would have been the area drain piping, which is eight inch duct line and a structure. Let's see. Again, we worked in SOG area A and B. Let's see, I got an order in the K and K for some PPE, basic gloves, some safety items, safety glasses approved by Eric. Expect that delivery tomorrow. And also I sent in a tool list of things needed for the project and equipment that Eric's gonna have Nate work on and get out to me. In SOG B, we worked on six inch sanitary, four inch grease waste. In SOG A, we worked on eight inch storm. That was it for the project for the day.
