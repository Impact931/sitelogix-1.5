Transcript: This recording is for Tuesday, July 26, 2022. Myself, Wes Clark, and Jack Obermiller both had eight hours of Mellow Mushroom today. I continued on the hot and return to the public bathrooms, started on demo in the public bathrooms, and moving piping to new locations. We installed backing for the mop sink and cut in missing hammer arresters that I was short on from Friday. This completes my recording.
