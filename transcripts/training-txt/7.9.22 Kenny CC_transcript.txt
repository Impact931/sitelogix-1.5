Transcript: Today is July 9th, Saturday, 2022, job reporting on the sitement. Myself, I had eight hours, Scott Russell, eight hours, and Wes Clark, eight hours, worked on 2C deck. I also had to install some hole covers over in, let's see, first elevated deck in area B that was poured. We had to get some hole covers and some four-inch sleeves, six-inch sleeves, got that taken care of. We got Wes set up on the deck. Come to find out, the whole time that I've been having trouble, Aaron had put second floor C control points with first floor C plumbing, TS plumbing model. So we couldn't get set up, it wouldn't work right. We finally got a hold of Aaron through Eric. He was able to change things for us. We got our new layout, new map with the right control points at about 12 o'clock. We were able to get set up after lunch around 12.45, everything's set up fine. The new post that we anchored down is working fine. We're able to start on the north side and work our way south, and then we're gonna wrap towards the west down the ramp. We got a portion of it done, but we still have quite a bit to do. I got approval from Eric, myself, and Wes are gonna work Sunday, and we're gonna knock out the rest of it. That was it for the project for today. Clayco did approve, a couple guys working on Sunday to wrap up the deck. That was it for job for today, no deliveries.
